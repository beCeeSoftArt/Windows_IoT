# DragonBoard

There is no configuration for Touch Screen to set. Because the smallest resolution of DragonBoard is 1820x720.
The DragonBoard works also good with normal HDMI Monitor with 1980x1080 Full HD.

Notice:
- The resolution will automatically set by Windows IoT Core and works very stable.
- The Dragonboard graphics is faster than on Rasberry Pi 3 because there we have an GPU that do some work for us.
