# DragonBoard

There is no configuration for Touch Screen to set. Because the smallest resolution of DragonBoard is 1820x720.

Notice:
- The resolution will automatically set by Windows IoT Core and works very stable.
- The Dragonboard graphics is faster than on Rasberry Pi 3 because there we have an GPU that do some work for us.
